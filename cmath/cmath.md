### Trigonometric Functions
***
* **`sin(x)`**
    Computes the sine of an angle `x` in radians. It returns a floating-point value between $-1$ and $1$.
* **`cos(x)`**
    Computes the cosine of an angle `x` in radians. It returns a floating-point value between $-1$ and $1$.

* **`atan2(y, x)`**
    Computes the arctangent of `y/x` using the signs of both arguments to determine the correct quadrant. It returns an angle in radians in the range $[-\pi, \pi]$.

***
### Rounding, Remainder, and Floating-Point Functions

    Computes the nearest integer value to `x`. It rounds half-way cases away from zero.

* **`remainder(x, y)`**
    Computes the floating-point remainder of `x / y` as defined by the IEEE 754 standard. The result is always between $-y/2$ and $y/2$.
* **`modf(x, iptr)`**
    Breaks a floating-point number into its integral and fractional parts. The fractional part is returned and the integral part is stored in the location pointed to by `iptr`.

***
### Error, Gamma, and Special Functions
***
* **`erf(x)`**
    Computes the error function of `x`. It is used in statistics and probability theory.
* **`erfc(x)`**
    Computes the complementary error function of `x`. It is defined as $1 - erf(x)$ and is more accurate for large `x`.
* **`tgamma(x)`**
    Computes the gamma function of `x`, $\Gamma(x)$. This is an extension of the factorial function to real and complex numbers.
* **`lgamma(x)`**
    Computes the natural logarithm of the absolute value of the gamma function of `x`. It is useful for avoiding overflow with large `x`.

***
### Classification and Comparison Functions
***
* **`isinf(x)`**
    Checks if `x` is an infinite value. It returns `true` if `x` is positive or negative infinity.
* **`isnan(x)`**
    Checks if `x` is "Not a Number" (NaN). It returns `true` if `x` cannot be represented as a valid floating-point number.
* **`isnormal(x)`**
    Checks if `x` is a normal floating-point number. It returns `true` for numbers that are not zero, subnormal, infinite, or NaN.
* **`isfinite(x)`**
    Checks if `x` is a finite value. It returns `true` if `x` is not an infinity or NaN.
* **`signbit(x)`**
    Checks the sign of the floating-point number `x`. It returns `true` if the sign bit of `x` is set.
* **`isgreater(x, y)`**
    Checks if `x > y`. This is a macro that avoids issues with NaN values.
* **`isless(x, y)`**
    Checks if `x < y`. Similar to `isgreater`, it handles NaN values properly.
