#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// ====================================================================================
// CONCEPT 1: BLUEPRINT FOR OBJECTS & USER-DEFINED DATA TYPE (The 'class')
// ====================================================================================
//
// In C++, a 'class' is a blueprint for creating objects. Think of it like an
// architect's plan for a house. The plan itself isn't a house, but it defines
// all the properties (like number of rooms, color) and functionalities (like
// opening doors, turning on lights) that any house built from that plan will have.
//
// A class is also a 'User-Defined Data Type'. Just like C++ has built-in types
// like 'int', 'float', and 'std::string', we can define our own complex data
// type using a class. Here, we are creating a new data type named 'Car'.
//
class Car {

// ====================================================================================
// CONCEPT 2: ACCESS SPECIFIERS (public, private, protected)
// ====================================================================================
//
// Access specifiers define how the members (variables and functions) of a class
// can be accessed.
//
// - public: Members declared as public can be accessed from anywhere outside the
//           class. This is the external interface of the class.
//
// - private: Members declared as private can ONLY be accessed by other member
//            functions inside this specific class. They are hidden from the outside
//            world. This is crucial for data protection.
//
// - protected: Similar to private, but they can also be accessed by derived classes
//              (in inheritance). We will not use it in this basic example.
//

// ====================================================================================
// CONCEPT 3: ENCAPSULATION (Bundling Data and Methods)
// ====================================================================================
//
// Encapsulation is the bundling of data (variables) and the methods (functions)
// that operate on that data into a single unit (the class). It also involves
// restricting direct access to some of the object's components.
//
// Below, we 'encapsulate' the car's data (brand, model, speed). We make the data
// 'private' to protect it from accidental or unauthorized changes. To interact
// with this data, you MUST use the 'public' functions we provide. This is also
// known as "data hiding".
//
private: // These members are hidden from the outside.
    std::string brand;
    std::string model;
    int year;
    int currentSpeed; // This is a critical piece of data we want to protect.

public: // This is the public 'interface' that the outside world can use.

    // This is a special function called a 'Constructor'.
    // It's called automatically when a new object of this class is created.
    // Its job is to initialize the object's data members.
    Car(std::string b, std::string m, int y) {
        brand = b;
        model = m;
        year = y;
        currentSpeed = 0; // A new car always starts with a speed of 0.
        std::cout << "A " << year << " " << brand << " " << model << " has been created." << std::endl;
    }

// ====================================================================================
// CONCEPT 4: ABSTRACTION (Hiding Complexity, Showing Essentials)
// ====================================================================================
//
// Abstraction means hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the
// essential features of the object. A driver of a real car doesn't need to know
// how the engine works to press the accelerator pedal. They just need to know
// that pressing it makes the car go faster.
//
// In our class, the functions below ('accelerate', 'brake', 'getSpeed', 'displayInfo')
// provide a simple interface to interact with a 'Car' object. The user of this class
// doesn't need to know *how* we are storing or changing the speed. They just call
// the function and it works. This is abstraction.
//

    // A public function to increase the car's speed.
    // This is part of the abstraction. The user calls accelerate(), they
    // don't directly touch 'currentSpeed'.
    void accelerate(int amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            currentSpeed += amount;
            std::cout << "Accelerating. Current speed: " << currentSpeed << " km/h." << std::endl;
        }
    }

    // A public function to decrease the car's speed.
    void brake(int amount) {
        if (amount > 0) {
            currentSpeed -= amount;
            if (currentSpeed < 0) {
                currentSpeed = 0; // Speed cannot be negative.
            }
            std::cout << "Braking. Current speed: " << currentSpeed << " km/h." << std::endl;
        }
    }

    // A public function to 'get' the value of a private variable.
    // This is called a "getter". It allows read-only access to a private member.
    int getSpeed() {
        return currentSpeed;
    }

    // A public function to display all the car's information.
    void displayInfo() {
        std::cout << "\n--- Car Details ---" << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Brand: " << brand << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Model: " << model << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Year: " << year << std::endl;
        std::cout << "-------------------\n" << std::endl;
    }
}; // The class definition ends with a semicolon.


// The main function where the program execution begins.
int main() {
    // ====================================================================================
    // CREATING OBJECTS (Instances of a Class)
    // ====================================================================================
    //
    // Here, we are using our 'Car' blueprint to create an actual car 'object'.
    // 'myCar' is an instance of the 'Car' class. We pass arguments to the
    // constructor to initialize its state.
    //
    Car myCar("Toyota", "Camry", 2023);

    // Now we can use the object's public methods (its interface) to interact with it.
    // This demonstrates ABSTRACTION. We don't care how displayInfo() works inside,
    // we just call it.
    myCar.displayInfo();

    // Using the public methods to change the object's state.
    myCar.accelerate(50);
    myCar.accelerate(30);
    myCar.brake(20);

    // Using the "getter" method to retrieve the current speed.
    std::cout << "Final speed check: " << myCar.getSpeed() << " km/h." << std::endl;


    // ====================================================================================
    // DEMONSTRATING ENCAPSULATION AND ACCESS SPECIFIERS
    // ====================================================================================
    //
    // The following line will cause a COMPILE ERROR if you uncomment it.
    // This is because 'currentSpeed' is a 'private' member of the Car class.
    // The private access specifier prevents us from directly accessing or modifying
    // it from outside the class. This protects the data and is the core of encapsulation.
    // You are forced to use the public methods like accelerate() and brake().

    // myCar.currentSpeed = 500; // <-- ERROR: 'int Car::currentSpeed' is private within this context

    // This is a good thing! It prevents someone from setting an invalid speed or
    // changing the car's state in an uncontrolled way.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// ====================================================================================
// C++ Static Members in a Class
// ====================================================================================
//
// In C++, the 'static' keyword changes the behavior of members within a class.
//
// Normally, every object (instance) of a class gets its own copy of all the
// data members. If you create 10 objects, you get 10 separate copies of each variable.
//
// 'static' members are different. They belong to the CLASS ITSELF, not to any
// individual object. This means there is only ONE copy of a static member,
// shared by ALL objects of that class.
//
// Think of it this way:
// - A regular member (like 'playerName') is a "personal" property of each object.
// - A static member (like 'playerCount') is a "public" or "shared" property of the entire class.
//

class Player {
private:
    // This is a REGULAR (non-static) data member.
    // Every Player object will have its OWN unique playerName.
    std::string playerName;

public:
    // ====================================================================================
    // 1. Static Data Member
    // ====================================================================================
    //
    // This is the DECLARATION of a static data member.
    // 'playerCount' will track the total number of Player objects that currently exist.
    // Because it is static, there is only ONE 'playerCount' variable that all Player
    // objects share. When one object changes it, all other objects see that change.
    //
    // NOTE: You cannot initialize it here (with some exceptions in modern C++ for const integrals).
    // The definition and initialization must happen outside the class.
    static int playerCount;

    // This is a constructor. It is called whenever a new Player object is created.
    Player(std::string name) {
        this->playerName = name;
        std::cout << "Player '" << this->playerName << "' has joined the game." << std::endl;

        // We increment the SHARED static counter.
        playerCount++;
    }

    // This is a destructor. It is called automatically when a Player object is destroyed
    // (e.g., when it goes out of scope).
    ~Player() {
        std::cout << "Player '" << this->playerName << "' has left the game." << std::endl;

        // We decrement the SHARED static counter.
        playerCount--;
    }

    // This is a regular member function. It can access both regular members (playerName)
    // and static members (playerCount).
    void displayInfo() {
        std::cout << "My name is: " << this->playerName << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Total players online right now: " << playerCount << std::endl;
    }

    // ====================================================================================
    // 2. Static Member Function
    // ====================================================================================
    //
    // A static member function also belongs to the CLASS, not to a specific object.
    // This has two important consequences:
    //
    //   A) It can be called directly using the class name, without needing an object.
    //      (e.g., 'Player::getActivePlayerCount();')
    //
    //   B) It can ONLY access other STATIC members of the class. It cannot access
    //      non-static members (like 'playerName') because it doesn't know WHICH
    //      object's 'playerName' to access. It has no 'this' pointer.
    //
    static void getActivePlayerCount() {
        std::cout << "[SERVER INFO] Total active players: " << playerCount << std::endl;

        // The following line would cause a COMPILE ERROR if you uncommented it,
        // because a static function cannot access a non-static member.
        // std::cout << playerName; // <-- ERROR! Which player's name would this be?
    }
};

// ====================================================================================
// 3. Definition and Initialization of the Static Data Member
// ====================================================================================
//
// This is a CRITICAL step. The static data member is only DECLARED inside the class.
// It must be DEFINED outside the class, in the global scope. This is where the
// compiler actually allocates memory for it and sets its initial value.
// You do this only ONCE for the entire program.
//
// Syntax: type ClassName::variableName = initial_value;
//
int Player::playerCount = 0;


int main() {
    // --- HOW TO USE STATIC MEMBERS ---

    // 1. Accessing static members BEFORE creating any objects.
    // Because static members belong to the class itself, you don't need an object
    // to access them. You use the Class Name and the Scope Resolution Operator (::).

    std::cout << "Game is starting..." << std::endl;

    // Calling the static function using the class name.
    Player::getActivePlayerCount();

    // You can also access the static data member directly if it's public.
    std::cout << "[SERVER INFO] Direct access to player count: " << Player::playerCount << std::endl;
    std::cout << "---------------------------------------" << std::endl;


    // 2. Creating objects and observing the static member change.
    std::cout << "Creating the first player..." << std::endl;
    Player p1("Alice");
    p1.displayInfo(); // Regular function call
    Player::getActivePlayerCount(); // Static function call
    std::cout << "---------------------------------------" << std::endl;


    std::cout << "Creating a second player..." << std::endl;
    Player p2("Bob");
    p1.displayInfo(); // Note how p1 now reports 2 players!
    p2.displayInfo(); // p2 also reports 2 players, because they share 'playerCount'.
    Player::getActivePlayerCount();
    std::cout << "---------------------------------------" << std::endl;

    // 3. Demonstrating object destruction and its effect on the static member.
    {
        // We create a temporary player inside a new scope block.
        std::cout << "A temporary player is joining..." << std::endl;
        Player tempPlayer("Charlie");
        Player::getActivePlayerCount();
        std::cout << "Temporary player is about to leave..." << std::endl;
    } // 'tempPlayer' goes out of scope here, so its destructor (~Player) is called.

    std::cout << "---------------------------------------" << std::endl;
    std::cout << "After temporary player has left:" << std::endl;
    Player::getActivePlayerCount();
    std::cout << "Game is ending..." << std::endl;

    return 0;
} // p1 and p2 go out of scope here. Their destructors are called, and playerCount will become 0.

```


```

Of course. Here is a single C++ file that provides a detailed explanation and demonstration of **static member functions**.

The entire explanation is embedded within the code's comments, explaining what they are, why they are used, their limitations, and how to call them.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>

// ====================================================================================
// C++ Static Member Functions
// ====================================================================================
//
// A static member function, like a static data member, belongs to the CLASS itself,
// not to any specific object (instance) of the class.
//
// Key Characteristics of Static Member Functions:
//
// 1.  NO 'this' POINTER: Since they are not associated with an object, they do not
//     have a 'this' pointer.
//
// 2.  ACCESS LIMITATIONS: Because they lack a 'this' pointer, they can ONLY access
//     other static members (both data and functions) of the class. They cannot
//     access non-static members.
//
// 3.  CALLING SYNTAX: They can be called directly using the class name and the
//     scope resolution operator (::), without needing to create an object of the class.
//
// Why use them?
// They are perfect for creating utility functions or functions that manage the
// shared (static) state of a class, like a factory function or a function to
// retrieve a static counter.
//

// Let's use an example of a class that manages game settings.
// These settings are global, so it makes sense for them to be static.
class GameConfig {
private:
    // These are static data members. There is only one copy of these
    // variables, shared across the entire program.
    static std::string difficulty;
    static int maxPlayers;

    // This is a NON-STATIC member, just for demonstration purposes.
    // Each object would have its own copy of this.
    int configVersion = 1;

public:
    // ====================================================================================
    // 1. A Static Member Function
    // ====================================================================================
    // This function sets the game's difficulty. Since 'difficulty' is a static
    // variable, the function that modifies it should also be static.
    static void setDifficulty(const std::string& d) {
        difficulty = d;
        std::cout << "[CONFIG SET] Difficulty set to: " << difficulty << std::endl;
    }

    // ====================================================================================
    // 2. Another Static Member Function
    // ====================================================================================
    // This static function can access another static data member ('maxPlayers').
    static void setMaxPlayers(int count) {
        if (count > 0 && count <= 100) {
            maxPlayers = count;
            std::cout << "[CONFIG SET] Max players set to: " << maxPlayers << std::endl;
        }
    }

    // ====================================================================================
    // 3. Demonstrating Access Limitations
    // ====================================================================================
    // This static function displays the current configuration.
    // It can freely access 'difficulty' and 'maxPlayers' because they are static.
    static void displayConfig() {
        std::cout << "\n--- Current Game Configuration ---" << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Difficulty: " << difficulty << std::endl;
        std::cout << "Max Players: " << maxPlayers << std::endl;
        std::cout << "----------------------------------" << std::endl;

        // The following line will cause a COMPILE ERROR if you uncomment it.
        // A static function has no 'this' pointer, so it doesn't know WHICH
        // object's 'configVersion' to access. This demonstrates the key
        // limitation of static member functions.
        //
        // std::cout << "Version: " << configVersion << std::endl; // <-- ERROR!
    }
};

// ====================================================================================
// Definition and Initialization of Static Data Members
// ====================================================================================
// Static data members must be defined outside the class in the global scope.
// This is where memory is allocated for them.
std::string GameConfig::difficulty = "Normal";
int GameConfig::maxPlayers = 10;


// The main function where program execution begins.
int main() {
    // ====================================================================================
    // HOW TO USE STATIC MEMBER FUNCTIONS
    // ====================================================================================

    // 1. The Standard Way: Using the Class Name
    //
    // You do NOT need to create an object of the GameConfig class to use its
    // static functions. You call them directly on the class itself.
    // Syntax: ClassName::staticFunctionName(arguments);

    std::cout << "Game is starting. Let's configure the settings." << std::endl;

    // We can view the default settings without creating any object.
    GameConfig::displayConfig();

    // Now, let's change the settings using the static functions.
    GameConfig::setDifficulty("Hard");
    GameConfig::setMaxPlayers(50);

    // Let's check the configuration again.
    GameConfig::displayConfig();


    // 2. The Alternative Way: Using an Object (Not Recommended)
    //
    // While it is possible to call a static function from an object of the class,
    // it is not the standard practice and can be misleading, as it implies the
    // function is related to the object's state, which it is not.
    // The C++ standard allows it, but it's better to use the ClassName:: syntax
    // for clarity.

    std::cout << "\nCreating a GameConfig object to demonstrate the alternative syntax..." << std::endl;
    GameConfig myConfigObject;

    // Calling the static function via the object instance.
    // This still modifies the one and only static 'difficulty' variable.
    myConfigObject.setDifficulty("Easy");

    // Proving that the change affected the static variable by calling the function
    // the standard way. You will see that the difficulty is now "Easy".
    GameConfig::displayConfig();

    return 0;
}
