Got it — let’s break down your `CMakeLists.txt` and the `../.. ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}` part, step-by-step.

---

### 1. What your snippet does

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
project(example)

add_subdirectory(../.. ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/termcolor EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)

add_executable(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE termcolor::termcolor)
```

---

### 2. Key commands explained

#### **`add_subdirectory(../.. ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/termcolor EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL)`**

* **`../..`** → Path to the `termcolor` library source **relative to your CMakeLists.txt file**.

  * `..` = go **up one folder**
  * `../..` = go **up two folders**
  * This means CMake will look for a `CMakeLists.txt` in that folder to build that library.
* **`${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/termcolor`** → Where CMake will put the **compiled library files** (the "build artifacts") inside your build directory.

  * `CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` = the folder where CMake is generating build files for the current directory.
* **`EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`** → Means the termcolor target won’t be built automatically unless something depends on it.

---

#### **`target_link_libraries(... termcolor::termcolor)`**

* This tells CMake:

  > “When building my `example` executable, also link the `termcolor` library so I can use it.”

---

### 3. The header file location

`termcolor` is **header-only** — no `.cpp` to compile — so:

* If you install it in your project:

  ```
  your_project/
  ├── CMakeLists.txt
  ├── main.cpp
  └── termcolor/
      └── termcolor.hpp
  ```

  You just:

  ```cmake
  target_include_directories(${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE termcolor)
  ```

  And in `main.cpp`:

  ```cpp
  #include "termcolor/termcolor.hpp"
  ```

* If you use `add_subdirectory`, CMake will automatically handle the include path if the library’s CMake config is correct.

---

### 4. Easier setup for header-only `termcolor`

You **don’t need** `add_subdirectory` at all for termcolor. Just:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
project(example)

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} main.cpp)
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE path/to/termcolor)
```

And have:

```
main.cpp
termcolor/termcolor.hpp
```

---

If you want, I can **draw a folder diagram** showing exactly where `termcolor.hpp` and `main.cpp` go so your CMake builds without confusion.
Want me to make that?



Alright — let’s break it down visually and mechanically so you see **exactly** how `../..` works, how `termcolor` fits in, and how `.h` / `.cpp` get compiled and linked into a final executable.

---

## 1. Understanding `../..` in **relative paths**

If your **CMakeLists.txt** is here:

```
/home/user/projects/example/CMakeLists.txt
```

Then:

* `..` = go up **one folder** → `/home/user/projects/`
* `../..` = go up **two folders** → `/home/user/`

So when you write:

```cmake
add_subdirectory(../.. ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/termcolor)
```

CMake will look for a `CMakeLists.txt` in `/home/user/` — not inside your current project — which usually means **termcolor** is located outside your project in some parent directory.

---

## 2. Folder diagram example with `../..`

Let’s pretend your folders look like this:

```
/home/user/
├── termcolor/                 ← library folder (has termcolor.hpp)
│   ├── CMakeLists.txt
│   └── termcolor.hpp
└── projects/
    └── example/
        ├── CMakeLists.txt
        └── main.cpp
```

From `example/`:

* `..` → `/home/user/projects/`
* `../..` → `/home/user/` (where `termcolor/` lives)

So `add_subdirectory(../.. …)` will **include** the termcolor CMake project into your build.

---

## 3. How header files and `.cpp` files work in C++

A C++ program is built in **two main stages**:

**(1) Compilation**

* Each `.cpp` file is compiled separately into an **object file** (`.o` or `.obj`).
* If your `.cpp` includes a `.h` file:

  ```cpp
  #include "termcolor/termcolor.hpp"
  ```

  The compiler literally **copies** the contents of that `.hpp` into your `.cpp` during preprocessing.

**(2) Linking**

* All `.o` files (and any precompiled libraries `.a` / `.so` / `.lib` / `.dll`) are linked together into a **final executable** (like `example` or `example.exe`).

---

## 4. Diagram of compile + link process for termcolor

Since `termcolor` is **header-only**, no `.cpp` files need to be compiled from the library — it’s just included in your `.cpp` when you `#include` it.

```
main.cpp  ----[compile]--→ main.o
                          \
                           +----[link]--→ example (final executable)
termcolor.hpp --[included]/
```

* The `termcolor.hpp` file is just **copied into** `main.cpp` at compile time.
* No `termcolor.cpp` exists, so nothing to compile separately.

---

## 5. Minimal CMake setup for header-only `termcolor`

**Folder:**

```
example/
├── CMakeLists.txt
├── main.cpp
└── termcolor/
    └── termcolor.hpp
```

**CMakeLists.txt**

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.5)
project(example)

add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME} main.cpp)
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})
```

**main.cpp**

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include "termcolor/termcolor.hpp"

int main() {
    std::cout << termcolor::red << "Hello "
              << termcolor::green << "World"
              << termcolor::reset << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

If you want, I can make you a **side-by-side diagram** showing:

1. **Your folder tree**
2. How `../..` navigates
3. The compile + link arrows visually

That will make the whole path + build process crystal clear.
Do you want me to prepare that diagram?
